%%Script to get beta values for each condition for each trial in a given
%%ROI. Written by Chris McNorgan many moons ago (as far as JY knows)

% What directory has all your subject folders? We assume that in each subject folder is
% a folder containing the SPM.mat file for that subject's 1st level analysis
rootDIR  = '/dors/gpc/JamesBooth/JBooth-Lab/BDL/jinwang/PhonReading_JW/raw_newpipeline/preprocessed';

% Where do you want the text file containing the betas to be written?
writeDIR  = rootDIR;

%How are your ROIs kept?
%1 = Everyone uses same ROI located in one location as is the case for
%standard analysis
%2= Everyone has their own ROI that is in a subject folder within a folder
%named with that ROI as is the case if paramObject was used
%3 = Everyone has their own ROI that is kept in the Analysis folder of the
%subject folders as is the case if PeakROI script is used
roistore = 2;

% If ROI store = 1 or 2, What directory has all your ROIS?
roi_file_root = [rootDIR '/IFG.oper_ROIs/'];

%what is your model directory?
modelDIR = ['/analysis/deweight'];

% make sure the scriptdir is in the path
addpath(pwd);

% set parameters
namerois = {'rIFG.oper_rhyme_vs_perc_T2_p1_k100'}; %put the name of the roi files here, omitting the '_rot.mat' part

%%% ALERT!!!!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%are you using a .nii or _roi.mat file? If using ROI location 3, assume
%.img file instead of .nii
roi_is_image=0; %1 if using .nii file, 0 if using _roi.mat file

%name all conditions that were modeled. You must name (and get the results
%from) all conditions, whether you're interested in them or not. Edit your
%text file to show the info you're interested in. This must match what is
%listed in the SPM.xX.name variable (found in the model dir for each
%subject)
nameconditions={'Sn(1) rhyme'  'Sn(1) onset'  'Sn(1) unrel'  'Sn(1) perc'  ...
                'Sn(2) rhyme'  'Sn(2) onset'  'Sn(2) unrel'  'Sn(2) perc'  ...
                'Sn(3) rhyme'  'Sn(3) onset'  'Sn(3) unrel'  'Sn(3) perc'  ...
                'Sn(4) rhyme'  'Sn(4) onset'  'Sn(4) unrel'  'Sn(4) perc'};

%These entries correspond to the condition names in nameconditions. I'd like to use these for column headings.
friendlyconditions=	{'T1rhyme1' 'T1onset1' 'T1unrel1' 'T1perc1' ...
    'T1rhyme2' 'T1onset2' 'T1unrel2' 'T1perc2' ...

    'T2rhyme2' 'T2onset2' 'T2unrel2' 'T2perc2' };
    
    %If doing PPI analysis, these should look something like this
%nameconditions={'Sn(1) seed','Sn(1) Oplus_vs_Ominus','Sn(1) seedxOplus_vs_Ominus','Sn(2) seed','Sn(2) Oplus_vs_Ominus','Sn(2) seedxOplus_vs_Ominus'};
